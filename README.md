<h1>MS Edge Rewards Collector</h1>
Microsoft has started giving points for using it's products like bing/edge etc.<br/>
However it is a tedious task to manually search and collect the rewards asap. <br/>
Hence this is a Python bot that automatically collects rewards on Edge by performing searches.<br/><br/>

This repository contains:<br/>
1. The python code (for people who know how to run it) <br/>
2. The .exe file which is very simple to download and use with 1 click.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps collect large rewards.
